### - RAG combines the power of retrieval and generative systems to improve our accuracy

### - Prompt engineering and further fine tuning to give the best experience possible<br/><br/>

### 1) Image Detection - Using Transfer Learning from ChatGPT for our image detection, we are able to detect and process a variety of food items even when there are multiple involved!

### 2) Database - For our Database we opted for MongoDB, giving us quick and easy access to our data, so we can use our RAG system effectively

### 3) RAG - With transfer learning from OpenAI we created a "Similarity LLM" which gives us similar food items and its allergens to improve the results

### 4) Frontend/App creation - For our frontend and app creation we used React Native to make the app compatible with your phone for quick and convenient use

### (Frontend with TypeScript, Backend with Python, and MQL for Database)
